Hey everyone! I built this Random Password Generator using React.js because, let’s be real—coming up with strong passwords is a pain. 😅 This tool helps you generate super-secure passwords instantly, with customizable options like length, alphabets, numbers, and special characters.

🎯 Features
✅ Instant Password Generation – No more thinking of random characters yourself!
✅ Customizable Length – Choose from 4 to 25 characters.
✅ Toggle Options – Pick what your password should include:

🔤 Alphabets (A-Z, a-z)
🔢 Numbers (0-9)
🔣 Special Characters (@, #, $, %, etc.)
✅ Copy to Clipboard – Just one click to copy.
✅ Password Strength Indicator – See if your password is Weak, Strong, or Very Strong.
✅ Dark Mode Support – Because who doesn’t love dark mode? 😎
✅ Fully Responsive – Works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.


🎮 How It Works?
1️⃣ Choose how long you want your password to be.
2️⃣ Select what type of characters you want to include.
3️⃣ Click "Generate Password" and boom! Your password appears.
4️⃣ Check the strength indicator to see how secure it is.
5️⃣ Click "Copy" to save it—no need to type it out manually.


💻 Tech Stack
This project was a fun way to explore React and frontend development. Here’s what I used:
🚀 React.js – To build the UI components
📜 JavaScript (ES6+) – For the password logic
🎨 CSS (Flexbox & Grid) – For making it look nice and responsive
⚛️ React Hooks (useState) – To manage the app’s state
🔄 Custom Hooks – To handle password generation logic

git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-generator.git

2️⃣ Go inside the project folder:
cd password-generator

3️⃣ Install the dependencies:

4️⃣ Start the development server:
npm start / npm run dev

5️⃣ Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and you’re good to go! 🚀
